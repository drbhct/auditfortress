# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# AuditFortress Vue to React Refactor

## Introduction/Overview

AuditFortress is a comprehensive HIPAA compliance management platform that helps healthcare organizations, EMR software companies, and business associates maintain regulatory compliance through document management, template systems, user training, and audit preparation. This PRD outlines the complete refactoring of the existing Vue 3 application into a React application with an aggressive 2-day timeline to achieve feature parity.

**Problem Statement**: The current Vue 3 application is fully functional but the development team needs to migrate to React for strategic technical reasons while maintaining all existing functionality and HIPAA compliance features.

**Goal**: Complete rewrite of the AuditFortress platform from Vue 3 to React with identical functionality, maintaining current design, and ensuring zero downtime for compliance-critical operations.

## Goals

1. **Complete Feature Parity**: Migrate 100% of existing functionality from Vue to React within 2 days
2. **Zero Regression**: Maintain all current HIPAA compliance features exactly as implemented
3. **Performance Optimization**: Improve application performance through React optimizations
4. **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Leverage React ecosystem for better TypeScript integration and component reusability
5. **Seamless Migration**: Ensure existing Supabase backend integration works identically
6. **Mobile Enhancement**: Improve mobile responsiveness during the migration process
